The code is very simple to use, until the user reaches the WKB part of the program.

h, n, π, w, m, x, E, u, x0, ℏ, L, A are the symbol to use for inputs. Either use sqrt() or ()** **(1/2)** to exprese a square root. For any other case, type ()**(n) to expresee the n-root.

If anyone finds themself stuck, have ideas on what I should add, or anything in between, email finn.christie282@mucsuci.edu
