# QM-tools-for-teaching

THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE THE READER TO KNOW THAT THE "QM_tools.py" IS DOG SHIT! IF THE READER WANT TO EITHER LOOK OR USE THIS PROJECT, THEN HE WOULD LIKE TO ASK THE READER TO LOOK AT "wave equation v2.py"

If anyone finds themself stuck, have ideas on what I should add, or anything in between, email finn.christie282@mucsuci.edu 

The comments below are only apply for "QM_tools.py"

The code(QM_tools.py) is very simple to use, until the user reaches the WKB part of the program.

h, n, π, w, m, x, E, u, x0, ℏ, L, A are the symbol to use for inputs. Either use sqrt() or ()** **(1/2)** to exprese a square root. For any other case, type ()**(n) to expresee the n-root.
